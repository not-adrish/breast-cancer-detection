# ü©∫ Breast Cancer Diagnosis with Bayesian Optimized LightGBM 

This project presents a high-performing binary classification model built using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset. Leveraging **LightGBM**, **automated hyperparameter tuning (Optuna)**, and **SHAP**, this notebook shows how to construct a machine learning pipeline that is accurate, interpretable, and even reproducible.

##  Why This Matters

Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers in the whole world, affecting **1 in 8 women** during their lifetime. Timely diagnosis can drastically improve survival rates. However, medical professionals continue to face challenges such as:

- **High workload and burnout**
- **Subtle abnormalities missed in early stages**
- **Variability in imaging interpretations**
This can seriously hinder early diagnosis

By combining statistical rigor and machine learning, we can **augment diagnostic workflows** and build tools that provide a "second set of eyes" to support medical practitioners.

This model uses **tabular features derived from digitized imaging** (e.g., texture, radius, compactness), which are often part of early screenings like mammograms or fine needle aspirations.

- Columns: mean radius', 'mean texture', 'mean perimeter', 'mean area',
       'mean smoothness', 'mean compactness', 'mean concavity',
       'mean concave points', 'mean symmetry', 'mean fractal dimension',
       'radius error', 'texture error', 'perimeter error', 'area error',
       'smoothness error', 'compactness error', 'concavity error',

## üî¨ Methods Used

### - 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Standard scaling of features for numerical stability.
- PCA for **visualization**.
- Split into train/test for performance validation.

### - 2. **Model: LightGBM Classifier**
- Gradient boosting decision trees, optimized for **speed** and **accuracy**.
- Handles **class imbalance** and works well on tabular data.

### - 3. **Hyperparameter Tuning: Optuna**
- Bayesian optimization to maximize F1 Score.
- Tuned parameters: `num_leaves`, `max_depth`, `learning_rate`, `subsample`, etc.
- Visualized importance of hyperparameters.

### - 4. **Interpretability: SHAP**
- TreeExplainer used to derive per-feature impact.
- Visualization of global feature importance.
